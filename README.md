## Overview
The project aims to:
1. Clean and preprocess a dataset of used cars.
2. Train a **Linear Regression model** to predict car prices.
3. Cluster cars using **KMeans** based on specific attributes.
4. Visualize relationships and distributions for insights.

- Extracts numerical values from columns like `Mileage`, `Engine`, and `Power`.
- Builds a regression model for price prediction.
- Creates scatter plots, heatmaps, and bar charts for analysis.
- Groups cars into clusters based on attributes.
